= How do I add new deals using the SpotlightYour plugin? =
Deals :: Add New Deal

This is where you input new offers or deals or items that you would like to Spotlight on your website.

= What is the best way to structure my deal titles? = 

The title of your offer that you are Spotlighting is incredibly important.  Below are a few exhibits that are proven to work amongst very successful deal websites.

Exhibit A:
${Sale Price} For ${Original Price} Worth of {name of product, service, or benefit from using the product or service}.

$25 for $50 of Bamboo Tree Climbing lessons from Marc's Backyard Jungle Gym.
$4 for $10 on any purchase at the Horne Brewery!
$97 for a $295 Rock Climbing Session from The Best Rock Climbing Gym in the World!
Why this works:  This works because it allows the website visitor to quickly see the original price and sale price of a product / service and decide if it is right for them.  Psychologically, knowing that we can get an item normally priced at $X for only $Y, gives us a sense of accomplishment.
Exhibit B:
___% Off at {name of product, service, or benefit from using the product or service}

80% Off at "insert business name here!"
50% Teeth Whitening service from "insert business name here."
50% off admission to "insert service, show, or business name here."
Why this works:  This works because nearly all humans can easily see that the discount is X% off.  This model has been used in the retail world for ages.

Exhibit C:
Headline: {name of product, service, or benefit from using the product or service}
Sub-headline: Combination of exhibit "A" &/or exhibit "B" above.

Horne's Family Restaurant
"$20 for $40 Worth of Drinks from our bar"
Marc's Backyard Jungle Gym
$25 for $50 of Bamboo Tree Climbing lessons
Why this works:  This works great because it lets the visitor immediately see who the merchant is and proceed to see the discount being offered by that merchant.
Exhibit D:
Headline: {name of off the wall activity, product, service, or benefit from using the product or service}.
Sub-headline: Combination of exhibit "A" &/or exhibit "B" above.

Go Skydiving in a Car!
Get 50% off a skydive jump inside a car!
Canopy Zip Line Tours
75% off all zip line tours at Marc's Backyard Jungle Gym
Swim with dolphins
$25 for a $145 swim lesson from a dolphin!  That's right, a dolphin!
Why this work does:  This works because it taps into our sense of adventure.  Even if I've never contemplated skydiving with a car I'm immediately picturing me doing this and wondering whether this could be a really cool activity to do with my friends.
Now, by adding personalization and past product purchase history to your headlines, you will accomplish even more and convert more prospects into customers.
Exhibit E:
{prospects First Name}, We know you like {past product or service purchased}, that's why we found you ___% Off at {name of product, service, or benefit from using the product or service}

Marc, we know that you like rock climbing so much - that is why we scoured the streets and found you 50% a rock climbing lesson from Chris Sharma, one of the world's best climbers.
Marc, we saw that you gave {restaurant "a" name} a {insert Yelp rating on restaurant} and so we knew that you would love {restaurant "b" name}
By using your subscriber's first name and past purchase history - you are able to connect with them much better and the message becomes more personalized.
= What is the best way to write my deal copy? =
Writing great, compelling copy is one the 7 habits of highly successful daily deal sites (http://www.dailydealmedia.com/6477-habits-of-highly-successful-daily-deal-sites/) and it all starts with the headline.  These are headlines that have worked for clients we have worked with and by no there is any guarantee they'll work for you.  However, they'll get you started on the right path to writing headlines for daily deals that demand attention, peak interest, and inspire action.

Description: Your description is very important as well.  After reading the title and looking at your deal image(s), your prospect will begin to read your deal copy.  Many successful coupon and deal sites use to keep their members and visitors coming back is to incorporate humor into their email, sales, and marketing copy.
Humor on a daily deal site can be extremely entertaining and can also keep users coming back to a site every day just to read the copy on the day's offers.  It can be a blessing, but it could also rapidly turn into a nightmare if not crafted with care.
Humor on a website comes in many different styles and if you are going to go down this route, you need to first define the comedic style of the company/website.  Humor comes in many forms and some can be off putting so defining your company style and sticking to it is important.

Some ideas on different comedic writing styles:

Parody - A humorous or satirical imitation of a serious piece of literature or writing.

Like, for example, if you wrote in the style of the King James Bible, or if you somehow incorporated elements from writings like Romeo & Juliet, or Dante's Inferno, or even modern writing from the likes of Dan Brown.

Burlesque - An artistic composition, especially literary or dramatic, that, for the sake of laughter, vulgarizes lofty material or treats ordinary material with mock dignity.  

An example of this would be if you were selling, say, the Encyclopedia Britannica and mentioned how the pages make for great toilet paper, or if you are selling socks you could talk about how the sock was one of the first and finest inventions of early man and throughout history the sock has made an appearance in any number of plays, books, fancy wardrobes, etc.

Sarcasm - Harsh or bitter derision or irony; using praise to mock.  

If you don't know what sarcasm is then I suggest you go back to grade school.  Either that or your IQ is so high that sarcasm falls short of even arriving at your ears.

Verbal irony - The use of words to convey a meaning that is the opposite of the literal meaning.

For example, if you are selling 50% off a day of paintball fun, you could mention how the bearer of the coupon will receive no bruises, should play in the buff, and/or would probably win if they didn't use the provided paintball guns but instead used their hands to throw the paintballs as fast and hard as they can.

Situational irony - A situation in which actions have an effect that is opposite from what was intended, so that the outcome is contrary to what was expected.  

For example, if you are selling hammers you could tell the story about that time you bought a hammer for a very good price from a deal website, only to find out your girlfriend bought you the same deal from the same website. You tell her that you already bought one.  You cancel your order and go to see her to discover that she canceled hers, thinking that you would keep your order.  So now you don't have any hammers.  You both go back to the deal site and each order a hammer.

Tall tales - Overly exaggerated or even obviously false stories.  

One time, I wrote such a tall tale when selling a pair of gloves on a deal site that I won a Hugo Award for the story I crafted.  I was invited to speak in Switzerland, and also received a complimentary ticket for two to visit the international space station.

Slapstick - Physical comedy; slips, slaps, etc.  

If you're selling electronic gear you could tell the story about how you got the same item delivered once and were so excited while opening the package that you fell down the stairs.  Then, when you held the item high over your head to show your friends, a bird pooped all over it.  You once took it to the bathroom with you and dropped it in the toilet, when you finally exited the bathroom the device worked fine, but you had three cuts, 5 bruises, and incredibly got pooped on by a bird, indoors, in your own bathroom.

The next important item to consider is the copywriter.  If your company decides that you want to take a burlesque approach and hire a writer who is adept at sarcasm, the results might not be exactly what you were looking for.  Basically the 'voice' of the copywriter needs to match the 'voice' of the company.
